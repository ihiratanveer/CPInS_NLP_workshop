Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. It allows you to build web applications easily and quickly, making it popular for developing small to medium-sized projects. Flask follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and provides a simple and flexible way to handle HTTP requests and responses.

Key features of Flask include:

Routing: Flask provides a routing mechanism that maps URLs to specific functions or view handlers. You can define routes for different URLs and HTTP methods, allowing you to handle different types of requests and create a RESTful API.

Templates: Flask supports template rendering, enabling you to create dynamic web pages using HTML templates combined with Python code. Templating engines like Jinja2 are integrated with Flask, allowing you to pass variables and logic to generate dynamic content.

Request Handling: Flask provides request and response objects that encapsulate incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses, making it easy to access request data, handle form submissions, and return data or HTML responses to the client.

Extensions and Libraries: Flask has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions and libraries that extend its functionality. These include Flask-WTF for form handling, Flask-SQLAlchemy for database integration, Flask-RESTful for building REST APIs, and many more.

Deployment Options: Flask can be deployed in various ways, from running the app locally for development and testing to deploying it on cloud platforms or servers. It also integrates well with other tools and frameworks, such as Docker and Nginx, allowing for seamless deployment and scalability.

Flask's simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent choice for developing web applications, including those that require deploying deep learning models for natural language processing tasks. By leveraging Flask, you can create interactive and user-friendly web interfaces that leverage the power of deep learning models to process textual data and provide meaningful insights.
