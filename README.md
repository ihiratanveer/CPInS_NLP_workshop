# Workshop Summary: Introduction to Natural Language Processing with Python and Deploying Deep Learning Models as Flask Apps

## Introduction
This workshop provided an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python and covered the process of deploying a deep learning model as a Flask web application. Participants gained hands-on experience with NLP concepts, Python libraries, and learned how to create an interactive web app that processes textual input on the server and displays the model's results.

## Summary
In this workshop, we covered the following key topics:

- **Introduction to NLP:**
    - Definition and scope of NLP
    - Importance and applications of NLP in various domains

- **Preprocessing Text Data:**
    - Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words or sentences
    - Stop word removal: Eliminating common and less meaningful words
    - Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms
    - Removing punctuation and special characters

- **Text Representation:**
    - Bag-of-Words (BoW): Transforming text into numerical feature vectors
    - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighing word importance in a document
    - Word Embeddings: Capturing semantic relationships between words using dense vector representations

- **Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification:**
    - Understanding sentiment analysis and its applications
    - Building a sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques
    - Supervised learning for text classification tasks
    - Building a text classifier using Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines

- **Deploying Deep Learning Models as Flask Apps:**
    - Introduction to Flask: A micro web framework in Python
    - Setting up a local Flask server
    - Defining routes and handling requests
    - Loading a pickled deep learning model on the server
    - Preprocessing textual input on the server
    - Passing preprocessed input to the deep learning model for inference
    - Displaying the model's results on a web app

- **Importance of Deploying DL Models as Apps:**
    - Centralized processing: Performing data processing and inference on a dedicated server
    - Scalability: Handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently
    - Security: Protecting the model and data by keeping them on the server
    - User-friendly interface: Providing a web-based UI for easy interaction with the model
    - Reusability: Enabling the model to be accessed by various client applications

Throughout the workshop, participants were provided with notebooks containing code examples and exercises to reinforce their understanding. By the end of the workshop, attendees gained a solid foundation in NLP, as well as the ability to deploy deep learning models as Flask web applications, allowing them to create user-friendly and scalable interfaces for their NLP models.
